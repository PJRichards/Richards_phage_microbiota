# Phage biocontrol of Campylobacter jejuni in chickens does not produce collateral effects on the gut microbiota

Phage biocontrol to reduce levels of *Campylobacter jejuni* in chickens and thus reduce human disease acquired through consumption of contaminated poultry products, is a promising sustainable technology. Investigating changes in the chicken microbiota during phage treatment has not previously been undertaken but is crucial to understanding global effects of such treatments. A phage cocktail containing 2 virulent *Campylobacter* phages were used to treat broiler chickens colonized with *C. jejuni* HPC5. *Campylobacter* counts from cecal contents were significantly reduced throughout the experimental period but were most effective 2 days post-treatment showing a reduction of 2.4 log10 CFU g-1 relative to mock-treated *Campylobacter* colonized controls. The administered phages replicated in vivo to establish stable populations. Bacteriophage predation of *C. jejuni* was not found to affect the microbiota structure but selectively reduced the relative abundance of *C. jejuni* without affecting other bacteria.
